Distributed utilities for proxy losses.

All-gather helpers that preserve gradient flow through the local rank's slice,
enabling globally-aware rank estimation in DDP training without breaking
autograd.

def all_gather_with_grad(tensor: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    All-gather a tensor across all workers, preserving gradients for the
    local rank's slice.

    Standard ``dist.all_gather`` returns detached tensors. This function
    replaces the local rank's slice in the output with the original tensor,
    so gradients flow back to the local model parameters. Other workers'
    slices remain stop-gradient, matching DDP semantics (each worker
    optimizes its own parameters via all-reduced gradients).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : torch.Tensor
        Local tensor to gather. Typically ``[N, C]`` logits from one GPU.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Concatenation of all workers' tensors along dim 0, shape
        ``[world_size * N, C]``. Gradient flows only through rows
        ``[rank*N : (rank+1)*N]``.

    Notes
    -----
    All workers' queues stay synchronized automatically: since every worker
    calls ``all_gather`` before passing to the loss, every worker enqueues
    the same global-batch data. No extra synchronization is needed.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``torch.distributed`` is not available or not initialized.

    Examples
    --------
    Typical usage in a DDP training step::

        from imbalanced_losses.distributed import all_gather_with_grad

        logits_global  = all_gather_with_grad(logits)          # [world*N, C]
        targets_global = all_gather_no_grad(targets)           # [world*N]
        loss = loss_fn(logits_global, targets_global)
        loss.backward()
